# Find Your Furniture

## Project Idea
Furniture marketplace for Berkeley students

## Purpose
Students moving out of their apartments or trying to furnish new ones currently donâ€™t have an easy way to sell and buy furniture from other Berkeley students. This website would provide an easy way to see what furniture is available near you, or to sell your own furniture to other students who are looking. The best part is that this would be a Berkeley student specific furniture marketplace!

## Usage
1. Create two databases in mongo: ```userinfo``` and ```posts```.
2. Navigate to ```backend``` folder and run ```node server.js```.
3. New a terminal and navigate to the ```frontend/furniture``` folder. Run ``` npm i``` and then ```npm start```. The website will show up.
